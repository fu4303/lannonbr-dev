Over the years I have been a fan of developer conferences. Before I got out into the professional world I didn't have the opportunity to attend them, but luckily many of them either livestreamed their content or put their talks up afterwards onto YouTube.

This is a list of conferences that I've watched over the years (and links to YouTube channels for VODs if available):

- Google I/O ([Google Developers YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers). Head to the playlists tab and look for Google I/O)
- WWDC
- [JSConf / CSSConf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzoVCacndDCfGDf41P-z0iA)
- [Nordic.js](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZ3O2cZo1b4JSwvhgBnAbw)
- Microsoft Build ([Microsoft Developer YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMica-v34Irf9KVTh6xx-g). Look for MS Build playlists)
- [React Conf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5vTaEhvh7dOHEyd1efcaQ)
- [Dot Conferences (dotGo, dotJS, dotCSS)](https://www.youtube.com/user/dotconferences/videos)
